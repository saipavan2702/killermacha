Hi Rajeev,

Happy New Year! Hope this email finds you well.

Below is a status update on the tasks currently in progress and recently completed. 

**1. Butterfly region canary fix**
Jira: https://jira.oci.oraclecorp.com/browse/EXASCALECS-35057
A PR is currently in progress. I am facing a few blockers and would need some inputs, as the changes impact almost all canaries running in the Butterfly region.
PR: https://devops.oci.oraclecorp.com/devops-coderepository/namespaces/axuxirvibvvo/projects/ECS/repositories/escs-sm/pullRequestsTabs/4204?_ctx=us-phoenix-1%2Cdevops_scm_central


**2. OCI-metadata finalize**
Jira: https://jira.oci.oraclecorp.com/browse/EXASCALECS-33911
The PR had a clean CI run and is now ready for review. It is to remove the metadata from the integration tests.
PR: https://devops.oci.oraclecorp.com/devops-coderepository/namespaces/axuxirvibvvo/projects/ECS/repositories/escs-sm/pullRequestsTabs/4137?_ctx=us-phoenix-1%2Cdevops_scm_central


**3. Metrics canary**
Jira: https://jira.oci.oraclecorp.com/browse/EXASCALECS-35340
This PR is ready to merge. It was paused earlier due to the change freeze. This is to remove jumphost dependency for metrics canary.
The change includes setting up `oci-curl` inside the container, which will be used across all canaries as part of the jumphost removal effort.
PR: https://devops.oci.oraclecorp.com/devops-coderepository/namespaces/axuxirvibvvo/projects/ECS/repositories/escs-sm/pullRequestsTabs/4145?_ctx=us-phoenix-1%2Cdevops_scm_central


**4. TS1 issue**
Jira: https://jira.oci.oraclecorp.com/browse/EXASCALECS-35538
The PR has been merged and the issue is fixed. (It's merged along with some runner change from pintu as we decided to not to merge normal PRs)
PR: https://devops.oci.oraclecorp.com/devops-coderepository/repositories/ocid1.devopsrepository.oc1.phx.amaaaaaaw4vcxbya3j4nh7uqzh4uqcmap24x67b2nfh3u3a3eorgnj3zyn6a/pull-requests-tabs/ocid1.devopspullrequest.oc1.phx.amaaaaaaw4vcxbyac4qnynxb5kj5jjuaou73k3njtrvp3zbvngb4ahkial2a?_ctx=us-phoenix-1%2Cdevops_scm_central


**5. Remove jumphost usage from canary**
Jira: https://jira.oci.oraclecorp.com/browse/EXASCALECS-35566
Work is in progress. 
We made changes to fetch VM cluster details directly from the container based on Nitesh’s findings, he was able to fetch VM cluster details using appropriate API calls from the container itself and is currently exploring a way to execute SQL as well.
These steps will be similar across multiple canaries, and the findings should help the wider team in removing the jumphost dependency.


**6. Help Nitesh in smdbvltconn jumphost removal**
Jira: https://jira.oci.oraclecorp.com/browse/EXASCALECS-35419
I helped Nitesh understand how to  run the  `oci-curl` from the container based on my metrics collection PR.
He was able to identify the required API calls to fetch VM cluster details for both `smdbvltconn` and `smdbvltnodeup` canaries.


**7. Help Adweta in guestvm canary jumphost removal**
Jira: https://jira.oci.oraclecorp.com/browse/EXASCALECS-35421
This is currently a work in progress. It requires setting up a bastion connection to execute guest VM patching.
Additionally, we need inputs on how to configure root access from the bastion connection to both VM nodes.
(We are reviewing and exploring the documented steps.)

Helped maintaining the devs pipeline clean as the IM tests was leaving resources in the devs env, had to clean them up manually/disable them for further runs. Got in touch with akshay to deploy the IM version which has fix for the issue.
Helped in multiple pipeline triages, canary triages, prod incidents which are brought up in SRE call. 

Thanks & regards,
Sai Pavan Macha
