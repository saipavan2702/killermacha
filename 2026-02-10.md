Erasure Coding First Principle
Erasure coding is a storage format denoted as (k, m)
• Original data is divided into k fragments
• m parity fragments are encoded using the Reed-Solomon finite field algebra
- 8KB encode/decode is ~4usec using CPU SIMD acceleration via the Intel ISA-L
library
• (k + m) fragments are placed across independent failure domains, i.e., across
different Exadata storage servers
Storage overhead = (k+m)/k
(k, m) erasure coding guarantees data availability with up to m failures by requiring
only k of (k + m) fragments for recovery
For example, an Exascale cluster of 6 storage servers using erasure coding (4,2)
tolerates up to 2 disk failures and requires 4 fragments for recovery, where the
storage overhead is (4+2)/4 = 1.5x
