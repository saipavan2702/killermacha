**Subject:** Leave Request for Convocation (June 18â€“20)

Hi Rajeev,

I hope you're doing well.

I would like to inform you that my institution is organizing its convocation ceremony from **June 19 to June 20**. You can find the official invitation and details at the following link: [https://nitrkl.ac.in/Convocation/Invitation](https://nitrkl.ac.in/Convocation/Invitation).

As this announcement was made only 10 days in advance, I was unable to book a flight. Due to limited travel options, I will be traveling by train, which requires additional time. Therefore, I kindly request **a 3-day personal leave from June 18 to June 20** to attend the convocation and related events.

I have ensured that no urgent work is pending during this period, and I will gladly compensate for any immediate tasks once I return.

I sincerely appreciate your understanding and support, and I hope you will consider approving this leave request.

Thank you.

Best regards,
**Sai Macha**
