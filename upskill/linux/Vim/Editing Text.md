**Bonus:**
- Visual select number list, press `g Ctrl + a` to increment each line cumulatively

## ✨ Multiline Editing

**Method 1: Using `:norm`**
```vim
v (select lines)
:norm I<text>     → Prepend text
:norm A<text>     → Append text
```

**Method 2: Visual Block Mode**
```vim
Ctrl + v (select column)
Shift + I or A
<type text>
Esc → Apply to all selected lines

```

**Method 3: Regex Substitute**
```vim
:'<,'>s/^/prefix/     → Add prefix to selected lines
:'<,'>s/$/suffix/     → Add suffix to selected lines

```

**Method 4: Line Range Commands**
```vim
:1,10 normal I//      → Add '//' to lines 1 to 10
```

### 🔹 Basic Increment (Normal/Visual Mode)
- Move the cursor over a number.
- Press `Ctrl-a` to increment it by 1.
- Press `Ctrl-x` to decrement it.

## 🚚 Moving Lines with `:m`

Use the `:m` command to move lines:

- `:m +1` — move line down by 1
- `:m -2` — move line up by 2
- `:m 3` — move line **after** line 3

**Steps:**

1. Select lines using `Shift+v`.
2. Press `:` (this pre-fills `:'<,'>`)
3. Type your command, like `m +1`.

## 📝 Line Completion (`Ctrl+x Ctrl+l`)

Completes an entire line by searching for matching lines in your **current buffer**  in insert mode.

1. Start typing part of a line.
2. Press `Ctrl+x` then `Ctrl+l`.
3. A popup menu appears with matching lines.
4. Use `Ctrl+n` / `Ctrl+p` to **navigate suggestions**.
5. Press `Enter` to **select** the desired line.

---

### 💡 Example

Given this in your file:
```js
function calculateTotal()
function calculateTax()
function printReceipt()
```

Typing:
```
func + Ctrl+x Ctrl+l
```
Will suggest:
- `function calculateTotal()`
- `function calculateTax()`
- `function printReceipt()`

---

### 🚀 Advanced Features

- Works across **multiple buffers** if `:set complete+=k`
- Supports **partial matches** (e.g., `cal` matches both `calculateTotal` and `calculateTax`)
- Combines well with other completion types:
  - `Ctrl+x Ctrl+f` — File name completion
  - `Ctrl+x Ctrl+o` — Omni-completion (language-aware)
  - `Ctrl+x Ctrl+n` — Keyword completion (current file)
