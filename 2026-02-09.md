Hi Mike,

I wanted to share a quick summary of three issues that recently occurred from our side, along with some suggestions on how we can further improve our pull request review process and avoid rushed merges going forward.

**1. Adweta – IT2802 Python Script**
Adweta made the required changes locally but forgot to push them before the merge, which resulted in incorrect code being merged.
**Fix PR:** [https://devops.oci.oraclecorp.com/devops-coderepository/namespaces/axuxirvibvvo/projects/ECS/repositories/escs-sm/pullRequestsTabs/4273/information](https://devops.oci.oraclecorp.com/devops-coderepository/namespaces/axuxirvibvvo/projects/ECS/repositories/escs-sm/pullRequestsTabs/4273/information)

**2. Macha – run-standalone.sh**
This involved both runner changes and script updates that led to issues post-merge. The root cause was a script change that did not account for the multi-cloud environment.
**Runner Changes PR:** [https://devops.oci.oraclecorp.com/devops-coderepository/namespaces/axuxirvibvvo/projects/ECS/repositories/escs-sm/pullRequestsTabs/4137/information](https://devops.oci.oraclecorp.com/devops-coderepository/namespaces/axuxirvibvvo/projects/ECS/repositories/escs-sm/pullRequestsTabs/4137/information)
**Fix PR:** [https://devops.oci.oraclecorp.com/devops-coderepository/namespaces/axuxirvibvvo/projects/ECS/repositories/escs-sm/pullRequestsTabs/4281/information](https://devops.oci.oraclecorp.com/devops-coderepository/namespaces/axuxirvibvvo/projects/ECS/repositories/escs-sm/pullRequestsTabs/4281/information)

**3. Nitesh – Canary Changes**
The changes passed locally in the intlsn environment but failed in the pipeline. Nitesh is currently investigating the root cause.
**Revert PR:** [https://devops.oci.oraclecorp.com/devops-coderepository/namespaces/axuxirvibvvo/projects/ECS/repositories/escs-sm/pullRequestsTabs/4283/differences](https://devops.oci.oraclecorp.com/devops-coderepository/namespaces/axuxirvibvvo/projects/ECS/repositories/escs-sm/pullRequestsTabs/4283/differences)

To minimize similar occurrences, we propose the following precautions:

* **Mandatory validation before merge:** Ensure that all local changes are pushed and accurately reflected in the PR before approval.
* **Avoid rushed merges:** Allow sufficient time for reviewers and owners to thoroughly validate changes, especially for runner, infrastructure, or pipeline-impacting updates.
* **Cross-environment considerations:** While testing in every environment may not always be feasible, we should take necessary precautions to ensure changes are designed to work across environments whenever possible.

We take these incidents seriously and are focusing on strengthening our review discipline to prevent repeats. Please let me know if you’d like us to incorporate any additional safeguards or if you have recommendations for further improving the workflow.

Thanks,
Macha
